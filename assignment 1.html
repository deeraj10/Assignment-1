            Before we diagnose ourselves with depression and low self esteem we should think there are still few people around us walking and breathing on the same land and air as we do facing great battles .

            This is a cruel cruel  World we’re living in, the rarest quality we see in people is minding their own business. For example if we see politicians they always talk ill about the opposite party and only in few occasions they talk about developments. Rather than hanging up with the past mistakes they can focus on preset and do some good to the needy…

                    Rather than providing unnecessary schemes to the public, the government should first implement a policy in our motherland that goes with a tag line saying “no beggar India”. There are lots of people around us without basic needs such as clothing, shelter and nourishment.  God! I’m not a dictator to help all those needy hope I had that power. At first they should adapt all those people sitting near temples, railways stations, shopping malls and so on begging , they should be given basic training to work according to their age and gender and they might be helpful in cleaning the surroundings and doing few jobs which they are capable of doing. The physically handicapped and old age people are excluded. This way we can take a new step in making India powerful . It’s  always heart breaking for me to see people who are born the same way as we did and begging around the streets for 1 or 2 rupees where we lavishly spend thousands of rupees uselessly, while many starve themselves without money.
